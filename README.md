# ateam39-NetworkVisualizer
## Everything is ready to be tested. Record any bugs or issues below:
- no error message when import file is not found (this is what pushes the import network and clear network controls so low so I'll fix that when I finish the error messages)
- no error message when export file is not found (this shouldn't even really error but if someone can get it to throw the exception let me know, I'll have it print to the console)
- should create SocialNetworkADT interface incase they want it
