# ateam39-NetworkVisualizer
## Everything is ready to be tested(in the functionality branch). Record any bugs or issues below:
- #### fixing / adding all comments
- ~~no error message when import file is not found (this is what pushes the import network and clear network controls so low so I'll fix that when I finish the error messages)~~
- ~~no error message when export file is not found (this shouldn't even really error but if someone can get it to throw the exception let me know, I'll have it print to the console)~~
- should create SocialNetworkADT interface incase they want it
- ~~still have to do undo redo~~ (we got rid of undo redo)
- ~~remove scene.setFill(Color.BLUE); from controller~~
- when user exits the program, add a prompt to the user whether to save to file or not
- right now if I choose to export/save to a file that contained previous text it just exports the network to graph along with the previous existing text. We need to clear the file first before we save into it
